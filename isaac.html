              When you are looking at a website, it is most likely that your
              browser will be receiving HTML and CSS from the web server that
              hosts the site. The web browser interprets the HTML and CSS code
              to create the page that you see. Most web pages also include extra
              content such as images, audio, video, or animations and this book
              will teach you how to prepare them for use on the web and then how
              to insert them into your web pages. Some sites also send
              JavaScript or Flash to your browser, and you will see how to add
              JavaScript and Flash in your web pages. Both of these technologies
              are advanced topics that you can go on to learn more about once
              you have mastered HTML and CSS, if you want to.
