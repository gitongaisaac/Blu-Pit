This is a practice website that i created to improve my skills on html and css.
It uses a variety of styles including images, flexbox, CSS grid and more.
The project also uses my main css file: This is my file that contains all the global styles that i use in almost all my prject. You can checkout the file in the Default repo.
The project is a website that offers hosting services, programming learning classes, marketing of websites for it's community, Portfolio servieces: it containes a bunch of templates that a member can use to create his/her own portfolio, Although all this is just fake since it does not do all that but that is basically its description.
The website has only one name for now; the home page. I might create more pages in the future to keep sharpening my skills.
