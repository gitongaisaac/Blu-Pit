# Blu-pit

This is a fake web design platform.

It is the second website i created after creating Loruki website; you can find it in my repos.

It was just to confirm that i was good in CSS. It if fully responsive however there are some minor hitches at this point, but it will be okay in a few.

After i have fixed the hitches i will deploy the website on netlify and provide the link for the same. It has only the home page but after some time i will add other pages.
